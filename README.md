# Car Segmentation Using Fully Convolution Network and Resnet18 as Encoder

Segmentation is the task of identifying and assigning each and every pixel in an image to a corresponding class. I have used the Camvid data with hand labelled mask . The model 
was trained for 40 epochs and the best model achieves an IOU of 0.7718.
